<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>
I find that it can be really hard to write about oneself because there is a fine balance between seeming too humble and too narcissistic. So I'll try my best.
</br></br>
I feel like finding the tech. comm. department was an unforeseen but very fortunate happenstance for me. When I first started at Metro I was convinced that I had to pursue a career in something "stable" so that I was assured a decent job. After a while though I realized how miserable this thought pattern made me feel. I didn't want to feel like I was being forced to do something I didn't want to do all for a paycheck. So I did a complete 180, and switched my focus from science to art. However, I yet again ran into another wall with this decision. Art was fun, no arguments there, but I felt like I didn't have guidance toward my projects. I craved that dichotomy between a creator and a client. That's when I found technical communication. I felt right at home in this department. This major was the perfect balance of structure, logical thinking, planning and creativity that had a bright future in the current job market. I felt like I could express myself and make a decent living. 
</br></br>
With that all said I spend a lot of my time working on projects from start to finish. I am pretty passionate about taking an idea as far as it can go until I have a product I am really proud of.
</br></br>
Other little factoids:
<ul>
<li>I used to be a barista for 5 years at Denver's own Paris on the Platte before it closed down this year. Therefore I am obsessed with coffee and latte art.</li>
<li>One product I have been working on since the summer is a dating app for polyamorous people. One of my closest guy friends is Poly so the project started as a joke and is now in the process of actually being coded.</li>
<li>In the second grade I was published in reading rainbow but I have yet to meet LeVar Burton.</li>
