	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>Now, this is a story all about how</br>
		My life got flipped-turned upside down</br>
		And I'd like to take a minute</br>
		Just sit right there</br>
		I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air</br>
	</br>
	In west Philadelphia born and raised</br>
	On the playground was where I spent most of my days</br>
	Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool</br>
	And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school</br>
	When a couple of guys who were up to no good</br>
	Started making trouble in my neighborhood</br>
	I got in one little fight and my mom got scared</br>
	She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'</br>
</br>
I whistled for a cab and when it came near</br>
The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror</br>
If anything I could say that this cab was rare</br>
But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, homes to Bel Air'</br>
</br>
I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8</br>
And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes smell ya later'</br>
I looked at my kingdom</br>
I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air</p>
